[Tic Tac Toe](https://tictactoeiparrea.netlify.app/)
 is a classic game where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid, aiming to get three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal. This project implements a simple web-based version of Tic Tac Toe using React, featuring a visually appealing neon-themed interface and the option to play against another player or against the computer.

## Features

* **Web-Based Interface:** Play the game directly in your web browser.
* **Player vs Player:** Two human players can play against each other.
* **Player vs Computer:** Challenge the computer in single-player mode.

## How to use?
Select players mode (1 player or 2 players). On one player mode you will be playing against the computer. On two players mode you will be playing with your friend, one after another.

The first player to have 3 consecutive icons in a row will be the winner. 

In case that the board gets full without anybody getting 3 icons in a row it will be a tie.
